üë¶üëß Chehra is a Face Recognition Web Application built using React at the Front-End, Node.js and Express at the Backend with PostgreSQL serving as the Database to store Usernames, E-Mail and their passwords using Hashing algorithm ‚ù§Ô∏è. It utilizes a ClarifAI Machine Learning Application Programming Interface (API) to detect Faces passed to it using Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Links. 

## Technology Stack 

- React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.

- Node.js: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking Input/Output API that is designed to optimize an application's throughput and scalability for real-time web applications.

- HTML and CSS: HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

- Express: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides various features that make web application development fast and easy which otherwise takes more time using only Node.js. Express.js is based on the Node.js middleware module called connect which in turn uses http module. So, any middleware which is based on connect will also work with Express.js.

- PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users. 

## Demonstration 

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. The Application has been likewise deployed [here](https://harshcasper206.herokuapp.com/).
